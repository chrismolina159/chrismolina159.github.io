		<h1>Who am I?</h1>

		<h2>Name:</h2>
		<p>Chris Molina pronounced(kris mo-lee-nuh)</p>
		<h2>Occupation:</h2>
		<p>Senior student at NYU. 3+ years of experience.</p>
		<h2>Daily activities:</h2>
		<p>Coding (of course), going to the gym to make up for sitting at a desk all day, playing chess or crossword puzzles on my phone, reading books about psychology, and basic human necessities.</p>
		<h2>Why computer science?</h2>
		<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've had a love for video games and have had a strong fascination with how things worked.  After realizing that being a video game tester may not be the best career path for me, I broadened my horizons to technology in general. Flip phones were becoming less popular, computers were getting faster, and video games' graphics were consistently improving, and I wanted to know the behind the screen information.  After taking my first computer science course in high school, I knew exactly what I wanted to study.  While I do not know super specifically how flip phones changed into iPhones, I still know some under the hood of technology information that I hope to use and expand upon in the work force.</p>
		<h2>Why create this website?</h2>
		<p>I want to showcase a little bit of my personality and a little bit of my coding abilities. Also, it's helpful to have a personal website that I can keep updated and tweak with various technologies.</p>
		<h2>What do I want to do in the future?</h2>
		<p>I really want to work in the cybersecurity industry, but before I can enter the field to the best of my ability, I need to practice and develop a strong foundation in software. So I am looking to be a software engineer for some time, until I feel comfortable and ready enough to proceed into the security field. How will that happen? Who knows, but I'm sure that I can make it happen some way or another.</p>
		<h2>Why do you have a page dedicated to quotes?</h2>
		<p>I like to collect random quotes that I come across. Whether they are from video games, books, movies, or random internet scrolling, I like to refer to as many quotes as I possibly can. So visit the quotes page to get a random quote from some of my favorites!</p>
