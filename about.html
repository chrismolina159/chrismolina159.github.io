				<h1>Who am I?</h1>
			</div>
			<div id="wrapper">
				<h2>Name:</h2>
				<p>Chris Molina pronounced(kris mo-lee-nuh)</p>
				<h2>Occupation:</h2>
				<p>A software engineer at AWS</p>
				<h2>Daily activities:</h2>
				<p>Coding (of course), going to the gym to make up for sitting at a desk all day, playing chess or crossword puzzles on my phone, reading books about psychology, and doing basic human necessities.</p>
				<h2>Why computer science?</h2>
				<p>
					Ever since I was a kid, I've had a love for video games and have had a strong fascination with how things worked.  After realizing that being a video game tester may not be the best career path for me, I broadened my horizons to technology in general.
					Flip phones were becoming less popular, computers were getting faster, and video games' graphics were consistently improving, and I wanted to know how.  After taking my first computer science course in high school, I knew exactly what I wanted to study.
					While I do not know the specifics of how flip phones eventually became iPhones, I have learned some information about software and how things work under the hood, and I hope to continue growing this information in my future jobs.
				</p>
				<h2>Why create this website?</h2>
				<p>
					I want to showcase a little bit of my personality, my appreciation for video game related fonts/appearances, and a little bit of my coding abilities. Also, it's helpful to have a personal website that I can keep updated and tweak with various technologies.
				</p>
				<h2>What do I want to do in the future?</h2>
				<p>
					This is the billion dollar question that took me 20+ years to come to a confident answer. I thought it would be a video game tester, then a senior engineer, then a cybersecurity expert, and now, I want to make video games. In a funny way, my dream has come full circle.
					How do I know that this dream won't change again in a few years? Well I've already started making my own video game! I am going to launch the game under a company I am planning on instantiating, and with lots of hope and even more luck, I hope to run my own game studio.
					We'll see what the future holds!
				</p>
				<h2>Why do you have a page dedicated to quotes?</h2>
				<p>I like to collect random quotes that I come across. Whether they are from video games, books, movies, or random internet scrolling, I like to refer to as many quotes as I possibly can. So visit the quotes page to get a random quote from some of my favorites!</p>
